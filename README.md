\maketitle
The generation of Process Flow Diagrams (PFDs) and Piping \& Instrumentation Diagrams (PIDs) remains a critical bottleneck in translating novel chemical discoveries into industrial practice. Current AI approaches often struggle with the domain specificity, contextual complexity, and data scarcity inherent in generating valid engineering schematics for new processes. This work introduces an integrated framework leveraging Small Language Models (SLMs) to automate PFD/PID generation, aiming to significantly accelerate the conceptual design phase. Our core methodology combines several key technical contributions: (1) Targeted SLM adaptation through diverse fine-tuning strategies; (2) A sophisticated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mechanism grounded in a dynamically constructed, structured knowledge graph; (3) An autonomous agentic framework for knowledge base construction from web sources; (4) Algorithmic and system-level optimizations for computational efficiency and output reliability; and (5) Integrated engineering validation. Specifically, we adapt pre-trained SLMs using a multi-stage fine-tuning pipeline that may incorporate supervised instruction tuning, preference optimization techniques like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for alignment, and potentially reinforcement learning methods such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to directly optimize for desired schematic characteristics using composite rewards. To overcome the limitations of intrinsic model knowledge, the framework employs an advanced RAG architecture. Central to this is a knowledge graph capturing structured information about chemical processes, equipment, instrumentation standards, and safety protocols. This graph enables the SLM to perform complex, multi-hop reasoning grounded in relevant engineering context. Addressing the challenge of populating this specialized graph, we utilize an autonomous agentic web navigation framework that systematically searches, interprets, and synthesizes information from heterogeneous online sources, structuring it for graph ingestion, thereby mitigating reliance on scarce, curated datasets. Recognizing the practical constraints of deployment, we integrate computational efficiency measures. Model compression via structured pruning (width and depth) reduces resource requirements. Inference is accelerated using optimized attention implementations (FlashAttention), efficient KV cache management (PagedAttention), and parallel decoding algorithms (Lookahead Decoding). Crucially, we also employ algorithmic test-time scaling techniques—combining multi-candidate sampling (e.g., Chain-of-Thought) with confidence-weighted scoring and iterative self-reflection/consistency checks—to enhance the factual accuracy and logical robustness of the generated outputs without retraining. Finally, the framework incorporates a quality assurance loop involving critique mechanisms (e.g., using reward models or LLM-as-judge) for iterative refinement. Importantly, it includes validation through external chemical process simulators (like DWSIM) to verify the engineering feasibility, material/energy balances, and control logic implied by the generated PFDs and PIDs. In summary, this research presents a comprehensive system for automated engineering schematic generation. By synergistically combining domain-adapted SLMs, structured knowledge graph-based RAG populated via autonomous agents, multi-faceted efficiency optimizations, and rigorous engineering validation, the framework offers a promising approach to accelerate the design lifecycle for novel chemical processes, bridging the gap between scientific discovery and industrial implementation.
