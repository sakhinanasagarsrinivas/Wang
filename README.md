Subject: Request for No Objection Certificate (NOC) for Canadian Visa Application

Dear \[HR Manager's Name],

I hope you're doing well.

As part of my upcoming official travel to Canada to attend the 31st ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD 2025), scheduled from August 3 to August 7, 2025 in Toronto, I am in the process of submitting my Temporary Resident Visa application to the Canadian High Commission.

While I already have the official letter of support issued by TCS, the visa process additionally requires a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the employer. I kindly request the NOC on official letterhead confirming:

* TCS has no objection to my travel for the specified period
* I am currently employed with TCS and have been granted leave
* I am expected to return and resume my duties post-travel

It would be greatly appreciated if the NOC could be issued at the earliest to support the timely completion of my visa application.

Please let me know if any further information or documentation is needed.

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,
Dr. Sagar Srinivas Sakhinana
