% Using \And between authors leaves it to \LaTeX{} to determine where to break
% the lines. Using \AND forces a linebreak at that point. So, if \LaTeX{}

\section*{Current Best-Practices}

\begin{itemize}

    \item \textbf{How is the work done today (what is the best-practice)?}  
    \begin{itemize}
        \item AI-driven workflows are widely adopted for:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Design automation and physical verification
            \item Yield enhancement through data analytics and defect classification
            \item Predictive maintenance using multivariate sensor data
            \item Defect detection and inline inspection analysis
        \end{itemize}
        \item Best-in-class practices include:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Digital twins for virtual process simulation and optimization
            \item Advanced Process Control (APC) for real-time recipe tuning
            \item Data-driven EDA and formal verification for design validation
        \end{itemize}
        \item Generative AI is in early-stage pilots but not yet standardized across fabs; its use is exploratory, mainly in defect review, SOP automation, and summarization.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{What are the key KPIs?}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Value KPIs:}  
        Yield (\%), scrap rate (ppm), cost per wafer (\$/wafer)

        \item \textbf{Performance KPIs:}  
        Equipment uptime (\%), mean time between failures (MTBF), throughput (wafers/hour)

        \item \textbf{Work Effectiveness KPIs:}  
        Time-to-yield (days), bug resolution time (hours), design cycle time (days)

        \item \textbf{Quality KPIs:}  
        Defect density (defects/cm\textsuperscript{2}), first pass yield (FPY), DPPM (defective parts per million)
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{What are representative values and historical trends?}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Current Values:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $\checkmark$ Yield: 92--95\% (mature nodes), 80--85\% (advanced nodes)
            \item $\checkmark$ Equipment uptime: >90\%
            \item $\checkmark$ Time-to-yield: 90--120 days (advanced nodes)
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Rate of Improvement:}  
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Yield: +2--3\% per year (node-dependent)  
            \item Uptime: +0.5--1\% per year through traditional predictive maintenance  
            \item Design cycle: 10--15\% reduction with AI-augmented EDA tools
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Contextual Note:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Margins Are Thin but Valuable:}  
        In high-volume semiconductor fabs, even 1--2\% absolute gains in yield or uptime can result in tens to hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue or cost savings.
        
        \item \textbf{Plateaued Gains Need New Methods:}  
        Year-over-year improvements have slowed, making traditional techniques insufficient for next-gen nodes. GenAI introduces new levers for optimization — enabling smarter, adaptive improvements beyond conventional APC or EDA tools.
        
        \item \textbf{Complexity Is Increasing:}  
        As process nodes scale down (<5nm), sustaining these KPIs requires more automation and intelligence. GenAI can help reduce engineering effort, debug time, and decision latency.
        
        \item \textbf{New KPIs Matter Too:}  
        GenAI also drives value by improving non-traditional but critical metrics such as:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Time to root cause
            \item Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR) for tool/process issues
            \item Knowledge retrieval latency
            \item Operator training time
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\section*{Key Challenges \& Ideas}

\begin{itemize}

    \item \textbf{What are the challenges in achieving the aspirational target? What makes achieving the target state difficult?}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Fragmented, heterogeneous fab data (e.g., sensor logs, metrology, SOPs) is difficult to integrate and align with GenAI workflows.
        \item Lack of domain-adapted foundation models tailored to semiconductor-specific reasoning tasks.
        \item Difficulty in establishing trust, explainability, and traceability for GenAI outputs in high-stakes fab environments.
        \item Limited access to labeled, high-quality data due to IP protection and vendor tool silos.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{What are the unique ideas that we believe will allow us to overcome the challenges?}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Combine GenAI agents with first-principles simulators and digital twins to create a closed feedback loop for design, tuning, and defect analysis.
        \item Deploy modular, tool-using agents grounded in fab ontologies and multimodal retrieval across documents, logs, tables, and images.

    \item \textbf{How differentiated will the ideas be? Will the differentiation be sustainable? What will we need to do to sustain differentiation?}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Differentiation:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Unique fusion of domain-adapted LLMs, agent frameworks, and simulator integration — not commonly deployed in real fabs today.
        \end{itemize}
