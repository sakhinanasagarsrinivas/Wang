\date{April 2025}

\begin{document}

\maketitle
The generation of Process Flow Diagrams (PFDs) and Piping \& Instrumentation Diagrams (PIDs) remains a critical bottleneck in translating novel chemical discoveries into industrial practice. Current AI approaches often struggle with the domain specificity, contextual complexity, and data scarcity inherent in generating valid engineering schematics for new processes. This work introduces an integrated framework leveraging Small Language Models (SLMs) to automate PFD/PID generation, aiming to significantly accelerate the conceptual design phase. Our core methodology combines several key technical contributions: (1) Targeted SLM adaptation through diverse fine-tuning strategies; (2) A sophisticated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mechanism grounded in a dynamically constructed, structured knowledge graph; (3) An autonomous agentic framework for knowledge base construction from web sources; (4) Algorithmic and system-level optimizations for computational efficiency and output reliability; and (5) Integrated engineering validation. Specifically, we adapt pre-trained SLMs using a multi-stage fine-tuning pipeline that may incorporate supervised instruction tuning, preference optimization techniques like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for alignment, and potentially reinforcement learning methods such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to directly optimize for desired schematic characteristics using composite rewards. To overcome the limitations of intrinsic model knowledge, the framework employs an advanced RAG architecture. Central to this is a knowledge graph capturing structured information about chemical processes, equipment, instrumentation standards, and safety protocols. This graph enables the SLM to perform complex, multi-hop reasoning grounded in relevant engineering context. Addressing the challenge of populating this specialized graph, we utilize an autonomous agentic web navigation framework that systematically searches, interprets, and synthesizes information from heterogeneous online sources, structuring it for graph ingestion, thereby mitigating reliance on scarce, curated datasets. Recognizing the practical constraints of deployment, we integrate computational efficiency measures. Model compression via structured pruning (width and depth) reduces resource requirements. Inference is accelerated using optimized attention implementations (FlashAttention), efficient KV cache management (PagedAttention), and parallel decoding algorithms (Lookahead Decoding). Crucially, we also employ algorithmic test-time scaling techniques—combining multi-candidate sampling (e.g., Chain-of-Thought) with confidence-weighted scoring and iterative self-reflection/consistency checks—to enhance the factual accuracy and logical robustness of the generated outputs without retraining. Finally, the framework incorporates a quality assurance loop involving critique mechanisms (e.g., using reward models or LLM-as-judge) for iterative refinement. Importantly, it includes validation through external chemical process simulators (like DWSIM) to verify the engineering feasibility, material/energy balances, and control logic implied by the generated PFDs and PIDs. In summary, this research presents a comprehensive system for automated engineering schematic generation. By synergistically combining domain-adapted SLMs, structured knowledge graph-based RAG populated via autonomous agents, multi-faceted efficiency optimizations, and rigorous engineering validation, the framework offers a promising approach to accelerate the design lifecycle for novel chemical processes, bridging the gap between scientific discovery and industrial implementation.


Unified Cross-Modal Frameworks for Molecular Generation and Property Prediction via LLM-GNN Integration
This work introduces two synergistic frameworks—FrontierX: LLM-MG for zero-shot molecule generation and MMF (Multi-Modal Fusion) for molecular property prediction—that strategically harness the complementary strengths of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) through modular, interpretable, and scalable architectures grounded in prompt-based querying and cross-modal representation learning. In FrontierX: LLM-MG, the goal is to perform text-based de novo molecule generation by translating natural language technical descriptions into structured SMILES strings. The framework begins with knowledge-augmented prompting, where a frozen LLM is queried using an augmented prompt containing task-specific instructions and few-shot demonstrations. The LLM returns both a ranked list of SMILES candidates and textual rationales. These rationales are encoded by a small-scale language model fine-tuned on generated explanations to obtain explanatory embeddings, while the original technical descriptions are encoded separately to obtain contextual embeddings. Simultaneously, the top-ranked SMILES predictions are transformed into prediction embeddings. All three modalities are fused using a hierarchical multi-head attention mechanism that first integrates mono-domain text embeddings and then combines them with prediction embeddings to form a cross-modal embedding, which is decoded via a transformer into SMILES sequences. In parallel, MMF addresses molecular property prediction by fusing graph-structured data with LLM-derived linguistic knowledge. The framework leverages zero-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to elicit rich textual descriptions from LLMs for input SMILES strings. These descriptions are encoded into token-level embeddings via a fine-tuned small LM, followed by softmax attention pooling to produce a fixed-length text-level embedding. In parallel, Chebyshev Graph Convolution (CGC) processes molecular graphs to generate graph-level embeddings. These are fused with text embeddings using a multi-head attention-based cross-modal fusion layer, enabling semantic alignment between graph topology and LLM-generated knowledge. Additionally, a few-shot ICL prompt guides the LLM to directly predict molecular properties; these predictions are encoded into prediction embeddings. The final output is computed using a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layer with a gating mechanism that adaptively weights the fused cross-modal and predictive embeddings to yield high-precision property outputs. Both frameworks follow a frozen LLM + fine-tuned LM paradigm and access LLMs through Language Modeling as a Service (LMaaS) via text-based APIs, eliminating the need for computationally intensive model fine-tuning. These architectures enable generalization to unseen molecular inputs via prompt conditioning, while remaining interpretable and computationally efficient due to the modular design and attention-based integration mechanisms. Collectively, the frameworks establish a novel direction in foundation model-based molecular machine learning by unifying symbolic and topological representations in a zero-/few-shot setting.
