Subject: Urgent: Request to Pay KDD 2025 Registration via Personal Credit Card for Visa Processing

Dear ,

I hope you are doing well.

I wanted to bring to your attention that the KDD 2025 conference organizers do not release the official invitation letter unless the registration fee is paid. This letter is mandatory for initiating the Canadian visa application, which currently takes around four weeks for processing, followed by three additional weeks for passport stamping.

Due to this requirement, the entire visa team and I have been delayed in submitting our visa applications, as we are still awaiting the registration confirmation. This delay is entirely due to the pending payment and may severely impact our ability to receive visas in time for the conference.

In light of this, I kindly request your approval to proceed with the payment using my personal credit card, and claim reimbursement through the standard process afterward. This will allow me to obtain the invitation letter immediately and move forward with the visa process without further delays.

Please let me know if this is acceptable, or if you need any additional information from my end.

Warm regards,

Senior Research Scientist
